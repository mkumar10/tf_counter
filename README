- To compile the file, use the following command:
  g++ -std=c++14 tf.cpp -o term_freq
- To run the file, use the following command:
  ./term_freq

Other Instructions:

- The words for which you would like to find the tf add them to the word_list.txt file.
- If you would like to add more documents, please add their names to the file_list.txt
  and make sure they are in the same directory.
- For simplicity, stop words have not been removed and I assume a word in the word_list occurs
  at least once in all the documents combined.
